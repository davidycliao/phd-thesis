I have conducted a series of robustness analysis to check the performance of the outcomes by adding surrounded islands (Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu) in the observations to the regression estimation in \autoref{tab:Robustness-of-Empirical-1} and \autoref{tab:Robustness-of-Empirical-2}. These municipalities are less populated but generally receive higher per-capita grant transfers distributed by the central government.
